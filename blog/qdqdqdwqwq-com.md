NEW DELHI: After Magnus Carlsen confirmed his return to the World Blitz Chess Championship following FIDE's decision to allow players to compete in jeans, the World No. 1 hit back at the body's deputy president Viswanathan Anand.

Carlsen found himself at the center of controversy after refusing to adhere to the rules and was fined $200 for wearing jeans, which are "explicitly prohibited" under the tournament regulations.

"Well, first of all, let's go back to a couple of days ago. I did have some choice words for FIDE in my interview with you. And I would say that it was a bit imprecise. I definitely mean it when it comes to certain people in FIDE. No question about it," Carlsen told 'Take Take Take', an app he is co-promoting.

"I think the situation was badly mishandled on their side. And I was about to basically book my plane tickets and get out of here. My father said that we should maybe wait until the morning to make a decision to speak to the FIDE president, Arkady Dvorkovich, whom we have a good relationship with," he added.

Carlsen stated that his discussions with Anand were unproductive, adding that the Indian was not suited for his position.

"We had long conversations with Anand yesterday and others, which generally didn't lead anywhere. It was generally the same answers, that arbiters are basically robots who cannot think on their own, who have no way to even deviate slightly from... I don't even know if I broke any rules. I still haven't gotten a clear answer on that," said Carlsen.
